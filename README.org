This is a repository containing all the resources we've made and used for group activities outside of hackathons/competitions

** How to use
The folders should have index.md or index.pdf, but it is recommended to use marp to present the content since
assets might not be loaded properly in the converted versions. An example of how to run it would be:
#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone https://github.com/neptyune/resources.git --depth=1
cd resources/<enter project name here>
npx @marp-team/marp-cli@^2 --bespoke.transition --preview index.md
#+END_SRC

For more options check the [[https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli][marp-cli github.]]

* Projects
** GoLang Group Project
    A simple TUI for git written in golang using the bubbletea framework. We've used this to learn how to
    contribute and work together using git, and consolidating our golang skills. This was done in prepartation
    for HackSheffield7 - A hackathon.
