# What is Nixos

NixOS is a declaritive, reproducable and reliable operating system. (package manager). It is built around the nix package manager (available on UNIX like systems). It is 'programmed' using Nix, the funcitonal programming language.
- No more "It worked on my computer".
- No more being left with a broken machine after an update.
- Easy to share dev environments (regardless of languages/tools).

# Getting Started with NixOS

Whilst working with nixos, there are two important files.
- `configuration.nix` Here we define the software side of things. What packages to install, what services to run, and the user to add.
- `hardware-configuration.nix` This is an autogenerated file, that contains details about what drives are being used, etc [more on the hardware side of things].

# Nix the package manager

Nix the package manager, does not abide to the standard installation paths. Rather, it installs all the packages in its `store` directory where the naming convention is of `hash-packagename`. This allows us to have multiple version of the same program installed.
For programs that need to be globally available/currently being used, a symlink is created to the standard `bin` directories.

# Nix-shell

Nix-shell has many features some of are which
- `shell.nix` We can have a file named `shell-nix` that launches a shell with all the dependencies a project might require. This way when we are all working on a project we can use the `nix-shell` to ensure that we are using the same version of the programs/dependencies.
- We sometimes install a program just to use it once and forget about it. Using nix-shell we can temporarily install an application. It will then be garbage collected automatically!. `nix-shell -p <package-name>`
